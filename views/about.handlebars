      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To make the beaches of east Greenwhich as clean as possible restoring it to its true form. 
        Well educating the youth about the importance of proper waste removal and the impact of our 
        decisions on the environment. 
      </p>
      <h2>How We Started</h2>
      <p>
       We started as a group of young highschool students during the pandemic with the goal of making our town beaches 
       cleaner for the sournding communities. We are now operating out of the east Greenwhich highschool as an after school 
       club allowing anyone in the community to participate.
